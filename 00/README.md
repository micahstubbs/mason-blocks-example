### US Federal Budget Balance, 1968-2017  

Remaining goals for this piece: 

1) animated transitions between years  
2) line or bar chart below which will show a time series of the budget item selected by the user by clicking on the sankey  
3) adjust discretionary/mandatory arrangement so the net interest link doesnt overlap
